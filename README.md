This is the initial assignment leveraging APIs. The Application Programming Interface (API) are used in combination with Python and JSON, to analyze weather data. </br>

API Querying:
<li>API Key was imported from external script and used as variable</li>
<li>Loops over the list of cities</li>
<li>No errors in the API call loop</li>

</br>

💻 Data Modeling:

A Pandas dataframe was created off the API call. The dataframe contained over 500 cities, with the following information successfully determined via coding: 
<li>City latitude</li>
<li>City longitude</li>
<li>Max temperature</li>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Cloud coverage</li>
<li>Wind speed</li>
<li>City country</li>

</br>

🎨 Plot Creation: </br> 

Using the previous information, a series of plots were created. The plots had axis and title tables. The plots include:
<li>Latitude vs Temperature</li>
<li>Latitude vs Humidity</li>
<li>Latitude vs Cloudiness</li>
<li>Latitude vs Wine Speed</li>

</br>

A linear regression was performed on the plot visuals, to further illustrate the relation between weather and location. This includes:
<li>Northern Hemisphere – Temperature (F) vs Latitude</li>
<li>Southern Hemisphere – Temperature (F) vs Latitude</li>
<li>Northern Hemisphere – Humidity (%) vs Latitude</li>
<li>Southern Hemisphere – Humidity (%) vs Latitude</li>
<li>Northern Hemisphere – Cloudiness (%) vs Latitude</li>
<li>Southern Hemisphere – Cloudiness vs Latitude</li>
<li>Northern Hemisphere – Wind Speed (mph) vs Latitude</li>
<li>Southern Hemisphere – Wind Speed (mph) vs Latitude</li>

</br>

🧮 Data Analysis:
</br>
Based on the analysis performed, three (3) trends were provided via a written evaluation. This involves sound reasoning to support the proposed trends. 


📍 Google Maps:
</br>
Finally, Google Maps were successfully created. The maps were created from the data modeling information. The maps were created using City, Country, Latitude, Longitude and Hotel Name, based on specified coding parameters. Additionally, clickable pins were displayed, showing the City, Country, and Hotel Name.
